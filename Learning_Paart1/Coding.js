/* 
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI(Body Mass Index), 
which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height)(mass in kg
and height in meter).


Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula(you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall.John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall.John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.
